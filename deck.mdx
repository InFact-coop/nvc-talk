## Check in and icebreaker

<Text>
  Go into your groups and do a 'check-in' - each person should say how they're
  feeling, in 3 words.
</Text>
<Text>
  Come back to the main room when you're finished, it should just take a minute!


</Text>


</TitleLayout>


<Notes>
  Allow 2 mins. Don't feel the pressure to be positive - if you're feeling good
  then of course that's great, but the point is to show up as your authentic
  self, no matter what that means right now.

## Intros

</TitleLayout>


<Notes>Just a tiny bit about us!</Notes>

---

<TitleLayout>


## Why should you care?

<Text>
  Go into your groups and discuss:
  <br /> - What are your biggest fears about this project? <br />- What are the biggest
  challenges you've faced so far in FAC?
</Text>
<Text>
  We'll bring you back in 3 minutes and ask a member of each group to give a
  short piece of feedback on what you found out.{" "}
</Text>

</TitleLayout>


<Notes>
  When they come back, ask for something they were scared of, or something that
  was challenging. Hopefully they will say something we can link back to NVC.
  E.g. if they're scared they won't be able to do it in time, ask - "What would
  you do if you couldn't complete the project in time?" - eventually it'll
  probably come down to having a conversation ðŸ˜¬

## NVC for us

</TitleLayout>


<Notes> All of us are interested in self-awareness and analysis, go to therapy etc.


and over half of startups fail in their first year because of relationship breakdown.

So when we had an internal conflict that we weren't talking about, We decided to get a mediator involved to help us facilitate a discussion. Paul from Navigate came and led us through a day of conversation using NVC techniques.

We found the techniques really useful and interesting, and have aimed since then to continue our exploration of NVC techniques.

It also overlaps with the Sociocracy training we did with Outlandish, which is a really useful tool in facilitating conversations as well.

All of us are doing this digital work because we're interested in helping solve problems using technology. We can't solve the problems unless we understand them, and we can't understand them without having effective conversations with clients. So it's important right from the beginning, even before there are any 'problems'!

## Background and basics of NVC

<Steps
style={{
    margin: `${theme.spacing.medium}`,
}}>


- Marshall Rosenberg grew up in Detroit
- We often use language which hides our feelings and needs
- NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and crucially to hear others,
- It trains us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify the behaviours and conditions that are affecting us.

</Steps>


</ListLayout>


<Notes>
  1. against a backdrop of the 1943 race riots.
  <br />
  2. It is as important, if not more important, in NVC to listen deeply as it is
  to talk.
  <br />
  2. to make our feelings and needs more transparent to ourselves and others
</Notes>

## Language which hides our feelings and needs

<Steps
style={{
    margin: `${theme.spacing.medium}`,
}}>


- The languages of disconnect or "self-alienating communication": diagnosis, denial of responsibility, demand, deserve
- Moralistic judgements
- Confusing feelings with thoughts
- Comparisons

</Steps>


</ListLayout>


<Notes>
  - Diagnosis language eg. "The problem with you is that you're too emotional",
  "You're a bastard", "I'm such an idiot!" <br /> <br />- Denial of
  responsibility language e.g. "But I had to stay late!", "It's annoying when
  you..", "I started coding because all my friends did" We are flawed beings and
  one mechanic that often happens in arguments is a protective denial of
  responsibility. TIP: Replace "I have to" with "I choose to" and "I should"
  with "I must" and use less impersonal pronouns. "It bugs me" vs "When you say
  this thing about me, I feel upset" <br /> <br />- Demand (not request)
  language + deserve language. Spending time trying to make people behave in the
  way that we want is not the purpose of NVC. This kind of dominance language
  relies on implicit or explicit threat of punishment to get what you want. Our
  society is build in demand language. "They deserve what they get" for instance
  underlies our criminal justice system. We believe in people getting their
  comeuppance and that fixing the underlying problem. But without needs met,
  what is fixed?
  <br /> <br />- Moralistic judgements which imply wrongness or badness. Wrong isn't
  a feeling, it's a thought. "You are the most self-centred person I've ever seen"
  <br /> <br />- Comparisons eg. "Why can't you be more like them?", "They're
  just so much better at this than me" - Confusing feelings and thoughts. "I
  feel like you did that on purpose"
</Notes>

## Language which reveals our feelings and needs

<Steps
  style={{
    margin: `${theme.spacing.medium}`,
  }}>


- Rosenberg believed that all judgements are unexpressed needs
- The trick is to talk in ways which allow us to understand the differences between our **observations**, our **feelings**, and our **needs**
- We use this insight to construct direct, clear, concise requests which would make the situation better for us

- 1. Observing without evaluating
- 2. Identifying and expressing feelings
- 3. Taking responsibility for our feelings
- 4. Requesting "that which would enrich life"

</Steps>


</ListLayout>
<Notes>
  - "You've not bothered to do anything" or "I noticed you haven't added
  anything to the code base in the last three days"
  <br /> - "I feel like you've checked out of this project" or "I feel upset and
  stressed out"
  <br /> - "You are so selfish" or "I feel hurt because I need recognition of
  the effort I'm putting in to this project"
  <br />- Direct, clear, concise. E.G. "Can you sort your life out or you and me
  are going to fall out big time" or "Would you be willing to sit down with me for
  the next half an hour and figure out a plan of action?"

## Mock example

</TitleLayout>


<Notes>
  First we'll demonstrate how a certain scenario might go down...
  <p
    style={{
      fontSize: `12px`,
    }}
  >
    - Arusa: "Agggghhh something isn't working properly!" <br />- Mandy: "What?!
    What's wrong?!"
    <br /> - Arusa: "I'm not sure.....and it's already 6pm.." <br />- Mandy: "We'd
    better prepare ourselves for an allnighter, I'm going to call my parents and
    say I'm not going to make to to theirs for dinner tonight"
    <br /> - Arusa: "Oh..sorry, I can't..."
    <br /> - Mandy: "What?! Why not? What are you doing??"
    <br /> - Arusa: "Um, nothing really, but its 6pm and I'm tired, I don't want
    to carry on and work late."
    <br /> - Mandy: "What do you mean? You're just going to leave me here so I have
    to fix it all by myself? I can't believe it, you don't even have any plans and
    this is so important, it's going to look bad for all of us if it's not working,
    you're so selfish!!"
    <br /> - Arusa: "Oh my god Mandy - I don't have to stay and fix this just
    because you think it's the right thing to do. You're so judgemental, you
    think being a martyr makes you better than everyone else. Well, stay up all
    night if you want, I'm out of here."

## Reflection technique & practice

<Notes>
  Go through technique and explain, then go through mock example using
  reflection technique

## NVC process technique & practice

<Text>
    Go into your groups and take it in turns to practice using the technique. You can use the same mock scenario, make one up, or think about a recent "conflict" in your own life. Probably best to keep it relatively light! </Text>
    <Text>e.g. How would you have used this technique to speak to a shopkeeper who was rude to you, or a person who jumped in line in front of you, or to navigate the last silly but annoying thing you encountered? </Text>
    <a href="https://whimsical.com/5yDYBAtqjRBTZmuJdg2LJE">Use this board to help you go through your example</a>
