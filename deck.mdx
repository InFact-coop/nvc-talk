## Check in and icebreaker

<Text>
  Go into your groups and do a 'check-in' - each person should say how they're
  feeling, in 3 words. Don't feel the pressure to be positive - if you're
  feeling good then of course that's great, but the point is to show up as your
  authentic self, no matter what that means right now.
</Text>
<Text>
  Come back to the main room when you're finished, it should just take a minute!

## Intros

</TitleLayout>


<Notes>Just a tiny bit about us!</Notes>

---

<TitleLayout>


## Why should you care?

<Text>
  Go into your groups and discuss:
  <br /> - What are your biggest fears about this project? <br />- What are the biggest
  challenges you've faced so far in FAC?
</Text>
<Text>
  We'll bring you back in 3 minutes and ask a member of each group to give a
  short piece of feedback on what you found out.{" "}
</Text>

</TitleLayout>


<Notes>
  When they come back, ask for something they were scared of, or something that
  was challenging. Hopefully they will say something we can link back to NVC.
  E.g. if they're scared they won't be able to do it in time, ask - "What would
  you do if you couldn't complete the project in time?" - eventually it'll
  probably come down to having a conversation ðŸ˜¬

## NVC for us

</TitleLayout>


<Notes> All of us are interested in self-awareness and analysis, go to therapy etc.


So when we had an internal conflict that we weren't talking about. We decided to get a mediator involved to help us facilitate a discussion. Paul from Navigate came and led us through a day of conversation using NVC techniques.

Over half of startups fail in their first year because of relationship breakdown.
We found the techniques really useful and interesting, and have aimed since then to continue our exploration of NVC techniques. It also overlaps with the Sociocracy training we did with Outlandish, which is a really useful tool in facilitating conversations as well.

All of us are doing this digital work because we're interested in helping solve problems using technology. We can't solve the problems unless we understand them, and we can't understand them without having effective conversations with clients. So it's important right from the beginning, even before there are any 'problems'!

## Background and basics of NVC

<Steps
style={{
    margin: `${theme.spacing.medium}`,
}}>


- Marshall Rosenberg grew up against the background of Jim Crow & the race riots
- We often use language which hides our feelings and needs
- NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and crucially to hear others, to make our feelings and needs more transparent to ourselves and others.
- It trains us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify the behaviours and conditions that are affecting us.

## Language which hides our feelings and needs

-     <Steps

  style={{
      margin: `${theme.spacing.medium}`,
  }}>

- Rosenberg believed that all judgements are unexpressed needs
- The languages of disconnect or "self-alienating communication": diagnosis, denial of responsibility, demand, deserve
- There's also moralistic judgements, confusing feelings with thoughts, and comparisons
  </Steps>


</ListLayout>


<Notes>
  - Diagnosis language eg. "The problem with you is that you're too emotional",
  "You're a bastard". We also do this to ourselves. There's also moralistic
  judgements in here. - Denial of responsibility language e.g. "But I had to
  stay late!", "It's annoying when you..", "I started coding because all my
  friends did" We are flawed beings and one mechanic that often happens in
  arguments is a protective denial of responsibility. TIP: Replace "I have to"
  with "I choose to" and "I should" with "I must" and use less impersonal
  pronouns. "It bugs me" vs "When you say this thing about me, I feel upset" -
  Demand (not request) language + deserve language. Spending time trying to make
  people behave in the way that we want is not the purpose of NVC. This kind of
  dominance language relies on implicit or explicit threat of punishment to get
  what you want. Our society is build in demand language. "They deserve what
  they get" for instance underlies our criminal justice system. We believe in
  people getting their comeuppance and that fixing the underlying problem. But
  without needs met, what is fixed? - Comparisons eg. "Why can't you be more
  like them?", "They're just so much better at this than me" - Moralistic
  judgements which imply wrongness or badness. Wrong isn't a feeling, it's a
  thought. "You are the most self-centred person I've ever seen" - Confusing
  feelings and thoughts. "I feel like you did that on purpose"

## Language which reveals our feelings and needs

<Steps


style={{
      margin: `${theme.spacing.medium}`,
  }}>

- The trick is to talk in ways which allow us to understand the differences between our observations, our feelings, and our needs, and to try to express these things without judgement.

## Mock example

</TitleLayout>


<Notes>
  First we'll demonstrate how a certain scenario might go down...
  <p
    style={{
      fontSize: `12px`,
    }}
  >
    - Arusa: "Agggghhh something isn't working properly!" <br />- Mandy: "What?!
    What's wrong?!"
    <br /> - Arusa: "I'm not sure.....and it's already 6pm.." <br />- Mandy: "We'd
    better prepare ourselves for an allnighter, I'm going to call my parents and
    say I'm not going to make to to theirs for dinner tonight"
    <br /> - Arusa: "Oh..sorry, I can't..."
    <br /> - Mandy: "What?! Why not? What are you doing??"
    <br /> - Arusa: "Um, nothing really, but its 6pm and I'm tired, I don't want
    to carry on and work late."
    <br /> - Mandy: "What do you mean? You're just going to leave me here so I have
    to fix it all by myself? I can't believe it, you don't even have any plans and
    this is so important, it's going to look bad for all of us if it's not working,
    you're so selfish!!"
    <br /> - Arusa: "Oh my god Mandy - I don't have to stay and fix this just
    because you think it's the right thing to do. You're so judgemental, you
    think being a martyr makes you better than everyone else. Well, stay up all
    night if you want, I'm out of here."

## Reflection technique & practice

</TitleLayout>


<Notes>
  Go through technique and explain, then go through mock example using
  reflection technique

## NVC process technique & practice

<Text>
    Go into your groups and take it in turns to practice using the technique. You can use the same mock scenario, make one up, or think about a recent "conflict" in your own life. Probably best to keep it relatively light! </Text>
    <Text>e.g. How would you have used this technique to speak to a shopkeeper who was rude to you, or a person who jumped in line in front of you, or to navigate the last silly but annoying thing you encountered? </Text>
    <a href="https://whimsical.com/5yDYBAtqjRBTZmuJdg2LJE">Use this board to help you go through your example</a>
